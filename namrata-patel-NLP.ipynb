Both in quality and price! I seriously have one of these rugs in every room of my house now. I ordered the 6-7 x 9' rug in Turquoise on 01/17/16 for $129 w/FREE Shipping. It was delivered in pristine condition less than a week later. Although it was a risk to buy a rug without seeing first in person, I was very happy with the outcome and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality yet affordable shag carpet. In fact, I've purchased several other rugs like this in various colors/sizes and have found them all to be of the same high quality.\\\nAPPEARANCE | This rug is absolutely gorgeous. The pile is just the right length and the shag is has a comfortable cushy texture that also looks amazing. It's all over soft and cozy and is the perfect area for performing my daily yoga routine. The material is thick, heavy (in a good way) and feels luxurious. My family members and guests love to sit on it. I've received many compliments (from\nboth males and females of varying ages) and it seems like everyone who enters the house is drawn to sitting on it!\\\nSHEDDING | It hardly sheds (only 4 or 5 threads fell out over the 1st month). I rarely find any loose threads. It's held up well to vacuuming, even with a Shop Vac.\\\nSTAINING/CLEANING | The rug is resistant to staining and spot cleans easily. Unlike virtually everything else in my house, it doesn't attract fur from my large German Shepard (who also loves to lay on it)! It's also \"kid-friendly,\" meaning that it's easy to keep clean and durable.\\\nCOMPETITION | I spent a lot of time researching shag rugs on Amazon, Wayfair, and Overstock.com prior to going with this one. Sweet Home brand was by far the best priced... It had a lot of positive reviews and I feel they were accurate. I'll definitely continue to buy from Sweet Home brand.\\\nCOLOR | The Turquoise is true to color, just as pictured. It's a light turquoise... Definitely NOT teal or baby blue. It's been easy to match with other turquoise-colored decor. I also have the Trellis Design in Charcoal-Cream. It's an attractive dark grey, definitely not black or blue, and the cream is... well, cream. I also have one in the lighter grey (also trellis design). It's best described as a neutral, maybe slightly cool toned (as opposed to warm) grey and the trellis pattern is also a light-medium cream.\\\nPLACEMENT | This huge rug rolled out nicely and stays in place. It's didn't buckle or roll up on itself, even on the 1st day. Note that I have one over carpet, one on wood flooring, and the others over tile. They retain their grip well on each type of surface and I do NOT use any rug pads under them.\\\nCOORDINATION | This rug adds visual interest to the room in terms of color and texture. Since I decorate with lots of white, silver, grey and clear lucite pieces, the turquoise prevents the room from looking sterile or drab. In order to tie in the vibrant color, I ordered some faux fur pillow covers in turquoise from the Euphoria CaliTime brand. The color isn't exact but it's close enough and looks awesome. (Sweet Home also makes a faux fur pillow in turquoise which appears to be an exact match but I passed on it as the cover is not detachable and I like to have the ability to wash them.) The overall look has major swag! It's chick, yet inviting and comfortable.\\\nINSPECT | When I bought a 2nd rug (the Trellis design in Charcoal/Cream), I ordered it in 6'7\" x 9'3\" but received one that was 4'11\" 6'8.\" I advise other buyers to inspect the size and confirm it's accurate upon arrival. The seller was SUPER cool about correcting the issue and even allowed me to keep the smaller-sized rug. I found this to be great customer service as returning a rug is NOT an easy task. Therefore, in the event that you do not receive the correct size or color, I urge you to NOT flip out and leave a nasty review.... Give them an opportunity to correct the issue first.
